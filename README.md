# RV32IF
The aim of this project was to build a running prototype of RISC-V processor i.e. RV32IF on FPGA. My implementation of RV32IF can be programmed using C to perform any float operation and display the result on computer through JTAG. This project was done using Altera DE 1 FPGA board and the language used was verilog HDL.
